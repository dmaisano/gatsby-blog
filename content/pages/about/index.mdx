title: About Me
---

Hi, my name's Domenico, or just Dom for short. I'm a first-gen Italian-American Software Engineer based in New Jersey. I enjoy working with computers, helping others and solving problems.

I have been fascinated with tech since I was a small kid. I initially majoried in IT/Network Administration but found my place in Computer Science along the way. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://computing.njit.edu/).

I have been writing software professionally for a few years now with different sets of teams, both in person and remotely. I've worked with Angular, Vue, and React; having a slight preference for React, especially in the case of working on my own projects. I have backend experience with NodeJS, [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/), and [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet).

I am currently looking for and open to new opportunities. If you would like to get in touch feel free to email me, [dmaisanooo@gmail.com](mailto:dmaisanooo@gmail.com).
